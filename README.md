# Fraxlend sfrxUSD vs. frxUSD comparisons
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that compares Fraxlend sfrxUSD and frxUSD asset markets at configurable utilization rates, borrow rates, lending rates, and sfrxUSD rates.

The goal of this repository to allow users to easily visualize the lending efficiency gains gained from switching to sfrxUSD markets exclusively.
The easiest way to run this repository without downloading any code is on MyBinder: https://mybinder.org/


# Next Steps
The under-development YieldTokenHelpers project, https://github.com/MichaelHenry32/YieldTokenHelpers, aims to create a maximally IFraxlendPair compatible wrapper around sfrxUSD to make UI visualization migrations trival. Of note, the YieldTokenHelpers will not be able to interact with the various "write" borrow methods.
